# L-Systems

A collection of L-System generators. Designed to output turtle-graphic commands  
to be interpreted by [Turtle-SVG](https://github.com/414owen/Turtle-SVG).

So far I'm just experimenting with different implementations, I will, at some  
point, abstract the L-System part away.

I've implemented sierpinski's triangle. Remember that to get an image, you'll  
need to pipe the output of the sierpinski program into [Turtle-SVG](https://github.com/414owen/Turtle-SVG).
